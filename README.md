# Overview

Implementation of maximum budgeted allocation problem.

1. PrimalDual((1 - beta / 4)(1 - epsilon)-approximation)
    * beta is the ratio of bid to budget(0 < beta <= 1)

# Maximum Budgeted Allocation Problem

There is a set of agents A and a set of items Q.  
Each agent i willing to pay b_ij on item j; each agent i also has a budget B_i.    
The goal is to allocate items to agents to maximize revenue.
